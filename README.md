The Master and the Masses  
One has power  
The other one lacks it  
Guns are power  
Controlled by assets  
Owned by financial forecasters  
Who are the Masters  
They are the Gangsters  
They are the bankers  
The ones who tax us  
The Masses  
They are us  
The sheep  
The people  
Divided in classes
